## How to run a python script on startup: ##


We need to create a systemd service that will run on each startup.

for example our service:
________________________________________________
[Unit]
Description=Run python script on system startup # A description for the service

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 python_exercise.py # Executable for the service
WorkingDirectory=/home/daniel/git_workspace/python_exercise # Workdir for the service
Restart=always # Restart service on fail

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target # systemd dependency - when all the system initialization is complete 
________________________________________________

Place it under:
/etc/systemd/system/python_exercise.service

Finally enable it by executing:
sudo systemctl enable servicename.service
